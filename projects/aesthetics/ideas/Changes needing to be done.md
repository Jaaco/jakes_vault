# Scrollable Dashboard for Charts Page
the dashboard is already a chart page in some regard. if all charts are merged into the dashboard then there could be another tab that can be filled with content, inplace of the chart tab.
with the scrollable dashboard, as many charts as necessary could be added to the bottom of the screen.

a good contender for this would be a page for workout plans and splits. this was a half-assed implementation as it stands right now anyways

the main problems here are the workouts, plans and exercises (now called workout plans and splits and exercises).
they don't have enough space to be fully explained and shown their imortance.

also, the actions on the dashboard should be 'shortcuts' to other places or quick actions. the  3 database buttons as seen in the screenshot are neither, so they should reside in another place.

the relevant actions in the dashboard should be
- start workout
- track bodyweight

profile and settings can reside in the outermost 'social' tab.

## additional ideas for the dashboard
instead of pop ups on click, expand the tiles
make sure this also makes sense for body weight and so on
in case of 1 tile per row just expand to make hight 2 rows, in case of 2 in 1 row leave the unexpanded, and expand the expanded around it torwards the bottom, in total height is 2 rows, and size of expanded is 3 tiles, unexpanded 1 tile
