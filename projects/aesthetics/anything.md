### Color Coding Exercises

add color codes to exercises depending on muscle group in exercise list
this could be a light background color or a colored bordered or bar in each tile
inspiration: color coded descriptions on machines in FitInn
probably grouped by 'large' or 'compound' muscle groups
legend either on each tile or at different place (maybe not needed at all)
