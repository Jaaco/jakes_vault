this part of the app is about exercises.
an exercise is for example:

Bench Press, Barbell, Main Muscle Group: Chest, Secondary Muscle Groups: Tricep and Front Delts

this should not be confused with an exercise that is performed during a workout, with sets and reps (this is a [Workout or Session Exercise])

the exercises will be organized into two distinct groups:
exercises from the global exercise database that everybody has access to, and personal exercises, that the user creates himself.

## Global Exercises

these can be accessed from every user and are available at all time. they cannot be edited by any user (maybe in the future they can [[Future Considerations Exercises#Global Exercise Changes | make changes]]  that will only be shown to them)
these should only be the basic exercises, that could be relevant to most people, but at the same time not be too empty

## User Exercises

these can be created by the user. they are only visible to themselves by default. they can be edited at any point.
these might be subject to sharing in the future [[Future Considerations Exercises#Sharing User Exercises | Sharing User Exercises]]

# Relevant to Rest of App

the main functionality this component should provide are:
- exercise and child models
- a pop up for selecting a single or multiple exercises
- a pop up for selection a single of mutliple muscle groups


## Models:
