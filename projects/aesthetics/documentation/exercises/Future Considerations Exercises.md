## Global Exercises for Companies

There could be optional imports for machines by different companies.
eg. a collection 'Gym80', which on selection would show all 'Gym80' machines to the user

## Global Exercise Changes

users could apply changes to global exercises, that would only be displayed to them
this could be done via an ExerciseChangeM model which would be linked by id to the original exercise and would modify it upon reading from database in a '.copyWith())' style

## Sharing User Exercises

users can share exercises. only with friends? community platform?
export and send in text form and import in app?
